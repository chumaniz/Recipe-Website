  <h1>Cape Malva Pudding</h1>

  <p>A soft, tantalizing sponge of pudding...straight from the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
  <ul>Ingredients:
    <li>1 tbsp butter room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>4 tbsp apricot jam</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla essence</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>½ tsp salt</li>
    <br>
    Sauce Ingredients:
    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>125 ml cream</li>
    <li>4 tbsp brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp water</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ol>Instructions
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180℃ (350℉). Ovens are temperamental, so if you know yours needs a bit more (or less) of a push, feel free to adjust.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl add your first 4 ingredients - butter, sugar, jam and egg. Beat until it lightens and gets a bit fluffier. If you only have a fork, the fluffy part isn't make-or-break.</li>
    <li>In a large measuring cup or a bowl, add milk, then vinegar and vanilla essence. Whisk lightly.</li>
    <li>In another measuring cup/bowl, add bicarb to flour and give it a quick stir.</li>
    <li>Alternating between the milk mixture and the flour, add to the large mixing bowl and mix well as you go along.</li>
    <li>Pour into a lightly greased oven-proof dish (ours was 30x15cm, but it could definitely have been a bit smaller).</li>
    <li>Bake for 45 minutes, or until a knife comes out with spongy crumbs stuck to it (it's not likely to come out clean) rather than uncooked batter. The pudding will stay in its mold and rest for a bit once the sauce is poured over.</li>
    <li>Add all sauce ingredients together in a pot and bring to a boil</li>
    <li>Let it simmer, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. This time will give the sauce a richer, deeper taste.</li>
    <li>Stab the pudding a few times with a fork to help the sauce sink in so that it doesn't pool at the sides and soak in only there. Then pour the sauce over slowly, being sure you're not leaving any part dry.</li>
    <li>All that's left is to enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
