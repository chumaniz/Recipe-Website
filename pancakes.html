  <p>Fluffy, buttery pancakes that send you over the moon early in the morning. In a rush? No stress! This recipe is for those in a rush, but wish not to compromise! </p>
  <ul>Ingredients
     <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
     <li>1 cup milk</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
     <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ol>Instructions
     <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth. </li>
     <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
     <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
